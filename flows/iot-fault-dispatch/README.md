# IoT — Auto Dispatch on Fault

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Flow name** | `andy_IoTFaultDispatch` |
| **Trigger** | Dataverse — When a row is added (`andy_iottelemetryevent`, `andy_mismatch eq true`) |
| **Solution** | AgenticIoT |
| **Connection reference** | `andy_shared_commondataserviceforapps` |

## Purpose

Automates technician dispatch when the IoT panel reports a mismatch fault. When a telemetry event is written to `andy_iottelemetryevent` with `andy_mismatch = true`, this flow:

1. Looks up the sensor record in `andy_iot_sensor` by `andy_deviceid`
2. Suppresses duplicate dispatch if an Open record already exists in `andy_dispatch_history` for that sensor
3. Queries all technicians with `andy_availability = Available`
4. Selects the nearest technician using squared Euclidean GPS distance (Δlat² + Δlon²)
5. Creates a `andy_dispatch_history` record (dispatch number auto-generated as `DISP-{YYYY}-{SEQNUM:5}`)
6. Sets the sensor `andy_sensor_status` → `Error` and links the active dispatch
7. Sets the technician `andy_availability` → `On Job`

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Flow-only (no agent call)** | Dispatch logic is deterministic — no NLU needed. Flow is more reliable and auditable. |
| **Sequential loop** | Variables used inside the Foreach require sequential mode to avoid race conditions. |
| **Squared Euclidean distance** | Sufficient for nearest-tech comparison. No trig overhead. Invalid for actual distance. |
| **Terminate Succeeded for guard skips** | Unknown device / duplicate suppression are expected conditions — no error noise in run history. |
| **Terminate Failed for no-tech** | Genuinely exceptional — surfaces in run history for investigation. |

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NO_TECHS_AVAILABLE` | No technician with Availability = Available exists. |
| `NO_TECH_SELECTED` | Loop completed but no tech was selected — likely all techs have null GPS coordinates. |

## Deployment

Import via solution or `scripts/Import-Flows.ps1` (when available). After import:
- Ensure the `andy_shared_commondataserviceforapps` connection reference is configured
- Turn on the flow
- Verify with a test telemetry record: set `andy_mismatch = true` on an existing sensor

## Updating this README

Update this file when:
- Trigger filter expression changes
- New guard conditions are added or removed
- Dispatch logic (tech selection, record creation) changes
- New connection references are added
